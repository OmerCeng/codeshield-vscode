# Changelog

All notable changes to the CodeShield extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.0.10]

### Enhanced
- **Massively Improved Pattern Detection**: All security vulnerability patterns now catch significantly more naming variations
  - API Key Detection: Now catches `apikey`, `api`, `api_key`, `apiKey`, `token`, `authtoken` and all camelCase/snake_case variations
  - Password Detection: Now catches `password`, `passwd`, `pwd`, `pass`, `dbpassword`, `database_pwd` and all variations
  - SQL Injection: Enhanced to detect `query`, `sql`, `cmd`, `command`, `exec`, `execute`, `run` method variations across all database libraries
  - Command Execution: Expanded to detect `eval`, `exec`, `execSync`, `spawn`, `system`, `shell_exec`, `Runtime.exec`, `Process.Start` across all languages
  - Path Traversal: Now detects all file operations including `readFile`, `writeFile`, `File`, `open`, `include`, `require` variations
  - XSS Detection: Enhanced DOM manipulation detection for `innerHTML`, `append`, `prepend`, `v-html`, `ng-bind-html`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
  - SSRF Detection: Now catches all HTTP libraries including `fetch`, `axios`, `requests`, `urllib`, `httpx`, `HttpClient`, `WebClient`
  - NoSQL Injection: Expanded MongoDB, Redis, and Elasticsearch operation detection
  - Prototype Pollution: Enhanced `Object.assign`, `merge`, `extend`, `__proto__` access detection

### Improved
- **Reduced False Negatives**: Pattern flexibility means fewer security vulnerabilities will be missed
- **Better Language Coverage**: Each pattern now includes variations from multiple languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, PHP, Go)
- **Smarter Variable Name Detection**: Word boundary detection (`\b`) ensures accurate matching without over-triggering
- **Case-Insensitive Matching**: Most patterns now use `/gi` flags for better coverage

### Technical
- All 9 major vulnerability pattern categories updated with 2-3x more detection patterns
- Added support for alternative method names (e.g., `executeQuery`, `executeUpdate`, `execute`)
- Enhanced regex patterns to catch library-specific variations (e.g., Lodash, jQuery, Express)
- Improved detection of dangerous property access (`__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`)
